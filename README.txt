This is the README file for John Jacobs' MP1 (To Do list app)

The basic functionality of this ToDo List web app will be to:
-Add and Remove list items
-Multiple Lists, with names
-Marking list items as done
-A button to delete all done items in a list
-Lists must persist between browser sessions

Further functionality might include:
-Be able to put lists in lists. And lists in lists in lists. And lists in those lists.
-Import / Export to some simple format.
-Deadlines and the ability to sort by deadlines (ascending and descending) or alphabetically
-Animations on almost all main actions
